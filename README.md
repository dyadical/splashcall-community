# splashcall-community

Community-contributed cards on SplashCall.

We are considering adding a custom card to splashcall.com that lets developers upload their own code to make new cards. Both people will have to enable developer mode in their settings. We will provide a simple API that you can hook into. Timeline on this is maybe an alpha release in September or October.
